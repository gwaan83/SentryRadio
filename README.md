# Sentry Radio 📡

**Sentry Radio** is a professional-grade Android forensic tool designed to detect, analyze, and map cellular network anomalies, including potential IMSI Catchers (Stingrays), cell site simulators, and suspicious network downgrades.

Built for security researchers and privacy-conscious users, it provides deep insights into the radio stack, monitoring both SIM slots in real-time.

**Version 0.2.0 - Now with enhanced security hardening and API protection.**

## 📥 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fzer0x/SentryRadio.git
   ```
2. Open in **Android Studio** and build the project.
3. Install the APK on your rooted device.
4. Grant Root/Superuser permissions when prompted.
5. **Enable "Display over other apps"** in the app settings to allow full-screen alarms.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Add your API keys in the app settings (now encrypted in Keystore):
- [OpenCellID API Key](https://opencellid.org/)
- [Unwired Labs Token](https://unwiredlabs.com/)
- BeaconDB (API-Keyless)

**v0.2.0:** API keys are automatically encrypted with AES-256-GCM.

---

## 🛡️ Security (v0.2.0)

Sentry Radio now includes better security hardening:

- **API Key Encryption:** AES-256-GCM encryption in Android Keystore
- **Certificate Pinning:** Public key pinning prevents MITM attacks on all APIs
- **Input Validation:** All data validated before processing
- **Full-screen Overlay Alarms:** Critical security alerts are displayed over other apps and on the lock screen.
- **Safe Root Execution:** Commands executed with timeout and resource limits
- **Audit Logging:** Security events logged for forensic analysis
- **Thread-Safe Code:** Race conditions eliminated, memory leaks fixed

---

## 🔐 Security Tab (v0.2.0)

New interactive security controls in dedicated Security tab:

- **Block GSM Registrations:** Forcefully prevent connections to 2G/GSM networks to mitigate downgrade attacks. When enabled, GSM registration attempts are rejected and the device is kept on LTE/5G.

- **Reject A5/0 Cipher:** Reject connections if the network requests A5/0 (No Encryption). If detected, the app forces a radio cycle to break the unencrypted connection and reconnect with ciphering enabled.

- **Threats Blocked Dashboard:** Shows real-time count of successfully blocked attacks with detailed logs:
  - GSM Downgrade attempts blocked
  - A5/0 (unencrypted) connections blocked
  - Silent SMS (Type-0) attempts detected

- **Blocking Events Log:** Complete history of blocked security threats with timestamps and severity levels. Includes options to unblock cells or clear logs.
